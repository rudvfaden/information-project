\begin{abstract}
In this project, I examine provider and patient demand for information in a dynamic model where the diagnostic precision is assumed to be related to physician effort, and effort is non-contractible. In each period where the patient and physician interact, the physician gathers information about the patient, and the diagnostic precision is increased. Therefore, optimal physician effort decreases as the physician and patient tie increases. As the physician is unobserved, the insurer compensates the physician by the average effort in the physician population and physician will not provide an optimal level of diagnostic precision in the in the first encounters with a new patient. Therefore the switching cost of the patient increases as the tie with the physician lengthens. This model explains (i) why the cost is negatively related with patient, physician ties and (ii) also introduces the concept of an ``information trap'', where competition is deceasing in the patient physician tie as switching cost increases. Increases.

\section{The Patients Utility}

Following \citet{Rochaix1989}, the patient has a utility function
\[
	U = u(t,s):\, T\times S\rightarrow\mathbb{R}
\]
where $t$ is treatment, $s$ is disease variable classified by its severity of illness, where both $t$ and $s$ traverse a real line. It is assumed that the utility function has both increasing and decreasing parts to capture the negative effects of both under and over treatment. It is further assumed that the dis-utility of moving away from the optimum is increasing in $s$, such that the patient is more \emph{risk-sensitive} for higher values of $s$.

%========== DEFINITION: Risk-sensitivity ==========%
\begin{defn}\label{def:risk-sensitivity}
Assuming that the decision problem has a unique solution $t^{*}(s)$, and for $s'>s$, $u(t^{*}(s),s)=u(t^{*}(s'),s')$. Then for $t^{*}(s)>t_{1}$, $t^{*}(s')>t_{2}$, $t_{2}\ge t_{1}$ and $t^{*}(s')-t_{2}=t^{*}(s)-t_{1}=\Delta t$, the \emph{risk-sensitivity} is monotonically increasing in $s$, if
\[
	0\le u(t^{*}(s),s)-u(t_{1},s)\le u(t^{*}(s'),s')-u(t_{2},s')\label{eq:risk-sensitivity}
\]
for all $s$ and $t$, and I write that $u(t_{1},s)\preceq u(t_{2},s')$.
\end{defn}
%==================================================%

The notion of \emph{risk-sensitivity} is illustrated in \cref{fig:The-patients-utility}.

%========== THEOREM: Single crossing property ==========%
\begin{thm}\label{thm:single-crossing}
If the risk sensitivity is increasing in $s$, then for $s'>s$ $u(t,s)$ has a single crossing property in $(s,t)$
\end{thm}
%==================================================%

%========== PROF - crossing property ==========%
\begin{proof}
Let $t'=t^{*}(s')$ and $t=t^{*}(s)$. Given \cref{def:risk-sensitivity}, it is clear that $t'\ge t_{2}>t\ge t_{1}$. Therefore I can rewrite \cref{eq:risk-sensitivity} as
\begin{align}
  u(t',s')-u(t_{2},s')\ge u(t,s)-u(t_{1},s)\ge0\label{eq:increasing-differences}
\end{align}
\cref{eq:increasing-differences} clearly have increasing differences in $s$ and thereby satisfies the single crossing property.
\end{proof}
%==================================================%

The intuition behind \cref{thm:single-crossing}, is that the marginal change $u(t',\cdot)-u(t,\cdot)$ is larger, when $s$ is larger. When $u(t,s)$ is differentiable and concave as in \cref{fig:The-patients-utility}, one might note $\partial u(t,s)/\partial t\ge0$ for $t\le t^{*}(s)$ and that for $\partial u(t,s)/\partial t\le0$ for $t\ge t^{*}(s)$. Thereby $\partial u(t,s')/\partial t>\partial u(t,s)/\partial t$ for $t\le t^{*}(s)$ and $\partial u(t,s')/\partial t<\partial u(t,s)/\partial t$ for $t\ge t^{*}(s)$. If $u(t,s)$ is convex, then one might note that $\partial u(t,s')/\partial t$ crosses $\partial u(t,s)/\partial t$ at most once and from below.

\end{figure}
%=======================================================%

%========== PROPOSITION: Single-crossing property ==========%
\begin{prop}
Given that $u(t',s)-u(t,s)$ has a single crossing property in $s$ and that both $S$ and $T$ are well ordered sets, then
\[
	t^{*}(s)=\argmax_{s\in S}u(t,s)\label{eq:increasing-solution}
\]
is increasing in $s$.\footnote{It should be noted that the assumption of quasi-supermodularity is not needed as the choice space is well ordered (e.i.\ a chain).}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
As both $T$ and $S$ are real lines, then it follows trivially that they are well ordered. For the rest of the proof see \textcite{Milgrom1994}
\end{proof}
%===========================================%

%========== EXAMPLE: Single-crossing ==========%
\begin{example}
A function with the properties defined in \cref{thm:single-crossing} and \cref{eq:risk-sensitivity} and have the form as in \cref{fig:The-patients-utility} is
\[
	u(t,s) = c-s{(s-t)}^{2}\label{eq:utility-example}
\]
where $t,s\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Assuming that \cref{eq:utility-example} is continuous and twice differential in $t,s$, the derivative $\partial^{2}u(t,s)\big/\partial t\partial s=2s^{2}\ge0$ and \cref{eq:utility-example} has increasing differences and thereby also a single crossing property in $(t,s)$.
\end{example}

%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Uncertainty with perfect agency}

In reality however, $s$ is never observed. The level of severity for the patients is a random variable represented by $S$, characterized by a subjective cdf. $F(s)$, with density $f(s)$, where $s$ is a realization of $S$. The expected value of choosing an admissible treatment intensity $t$ is given by
\[
	u(t,S)=E[u(t,s)]=\max_{t}\int_{S}u(t,s)dF(s)\label{eq:expected-utility-prior}
\]
It is however possible to acquire costly information about $s$ through medical diagnostics and physician effort. However, for two experiment $X,Y$ on $S$, it is not a priori certain that one experiment $X$ is necessary more \emph{informative} about $s$ than the experiment $Y$, where \emph{informative} is to be understood in the way the posterior decision induced by the experiment $X$ insures greater expected utility than the decision induced by the experiment $Y$. Therefore we must introduce an order of information.

%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Section: Information ordering
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Information ordering}

%========== DEFINITION: affiliation ==========%
\begin{defn}\label{def:afflilation} \parencite{Milgrom1982}
For a family of density functions, let $x\lor s$ denote the component wise maximum and $x\land s$ the component wise minimum. Then $x$ and $s$ are affiliated if for all $s$ and $x$
\[
	f(s\lor x)f(s\land x)\ge f(s)f(x)
\]
\end{defn}
%=============================================%

Affiliation of two random variables are equivalent to the monotone likelihood ratio property, and the intuition behind definition\cref{def:afflilation} is that higher signal realization of $x$ makes the probability that $s$ is large, higher. Similarly small signal realization of $x$ makes the probability of a small $s$ more likely.

%========== DEFINITION: Accuracy ==========%
\begin{defn}\label{def:accuracy}
\parencite{Persico2000} Given two signals (experiments) $X^{\eta}$ and $X^{\eta'}$, $X^{\eta'}$ is more accurate than $X^{\eta}$ if
\[
	T(x)=F^{\eta'^{-1}}(F^{\eta}(x\mid s)\mid s)\label{eq:acuracy tranformation}
\]
is non decreasing in $s$ for all $x$.

A family of signals $\left \{ X^{\eta}\right \} _{\eta\in E}$ is accuracy ordered (A-ordered) if a signal with higher index is more accurate than a signal with lower index.
\end{defn}
%================================================%

To understand the concept of accuracy, it can be noted that
\[
	T(X^{\eta}\mid s)\sim X^{\eta'}\mid s
\]
Thus a more accurate signal can be obtained from a less accurate signal, by the transformation $T(X)$. For a better understanding of the accuracy concept, see \cref{ex:t-transformation-1,ex:t-transformation-2}.

%========== EXAMPLE: T-transformation 1 ==========%
\begin{example}\label{ex:t-transformation-1}
Let  $\eta\in[0,\infty]$ and let $S$ be distributed according to any CDF and let $X_{\eta}\sim\mathbb{U}(s-1/\eta,s+1/\eta)$. Then for $\eta'>\eta$
\[
\frac{\eta'}{2}=\frac{\eta}{2}\left(T^{-1}(x)\right)'\Leftrightarrow T(x)=\frac{\eta}{\eta'}(x-s)+s
\]
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../fig/t-transformation.pdf}
	\caption{\label{fig:t-transformation}The $T(x)$ transformation}
\end{figure}

Thus, $T(x)$ transforms $X^{\eta}$ into $X^{\eta'}$ \citep{Persico1996}. See also \cref{fig:t-transformation}.
\end{example}
%=======================================================%
An illustrative example can also be given by applying \cref{eq:acuracy tranformation} to hypothesis testing.

%========== EXAMPLE: T-transformation 2==========%
\begin{example}\label{ex:t-transformation-2}
Consider the case where $s$ can take two values $s_{1}<s_{2}$. Let $X^{\eta}$ be a information structure affiliated with $S$. The optimal test based on $X^{\eta}$ is given by the rejection region $X^{\eta}>x^{*}$, such that $s_{1}$ is rejected in favor of $s_{2}$ when $X^{\eta}>x^{*}$. The probability of a type I error is then $\mathbb{P}(X^{\eta}\le x^{*})=F(x^{*}\mid s_{2})$ and the probability of a type II error is $1-F(x^{*}\mid s_{1})$. Now given that $X^{\eta'}$ is more accurate than $X^{\eta}$ is is possible to design a test with the same probability of type I error, by choosing $x^{**}$ such that $F(x^{**}\mid s_{2})=F(x^{*}\mid s_{2})$ (e.i. \ accept $s_{2}$ if $X^{\eta}\ge x^{**}$). However, since $X^{\eta'}$ is more accurate than $X^{\eta}$, then $x^{**}\ge F^{\eta'^{-1}}(F^{\eta}(x\mid s_{1})\mid s_{1})$. As $x^{**}$ lies on or, to the right of $x^{*}$ then the test based on $X^{\eta'}$ is a least as powerful as the test based on $X^{\eta}$
\citep{Lehmann1988,Persico2000}.\footnote{For a graphical example, see \cref{app:test-power}}
\end{example}
%=====================================================%

%% Subsection: Demand for information
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Demand for information}

Given that we now know, when a test can be considered more informative than another, I can know turn to the problem of informativeness.

%========== THEOREM: informative ==========%
\begin{thm}\label{thm:informative}
\parencite{Persico2000}
Suppose that $X^{\eta}$ and $X^{\eta'}$ are affiliated with $S$ and that $\left \{X^{\eta}\right \} _{\eta\in E}$ is A-ordered, such that $X^{\eta'}$ is more accurate than $X^{\eta}$. Then for all utility functions with a single crossing property, $X^{\eta'}$ is more informative than $X^{\eta}$.
\end{thm}
% the real important fact here is that u is monotonically increasing in s
\begin{proof}
See \citet{Lehmann1988} section 4 and \citet{Karlin1956a} Lemma 3--4 and theorem 1.
\end{proof}
%=============================================%

It follows directly from \cref{thm:informative} that when $X^{\eta'}$ is more informative than $X^{\eta}$, then
\begin{align*}
	\int_{X}\int_{S}u(t,s)dG^{\eta'}(s\mid x)dF(x)&\geq \int_{X}\int_{S}u(t,s)dG^{\eta}(s\mid x)dF(x) \Leftrightarrow \\
	U(t,s;\eta')&\geq U(s,t;\eta)
\end{align*}
From the above equation, it is clear that the patient will always prefer a more accurate signal to a less accurate signal. Further, \textcite{Athey2002} also shows that solution given in \cref{eq:increasing-solution} is robust to uncertainty, such that
\[
	t^*(x)=\argmax_{s\in S, x\in X}\int_Su(t,s)d G^\eta(s\mid x)
\]
is increasing in $x$, whenever $x$ and $s$ are affiliated.\footnote{Note that here we, unlike in \cref{thm:informative}, consider the problem of deciding a treatment $t$ before the state $s$ is know, but \emph{after} observing the signal $x$}

%% Section: The physician problem
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{The physician problem}

The physician has a utility function given by
\[
	V=v(M,\eta)
\]
where the physicians payment, $M$ is given by
\[
	M=\delta+(p-\omega)q
\]
where $\delta$ is a fixed payment, $p$ is the physician payment per unit of treatment, $q$ is quantity of treatment.

I also assume that the physician can increase the quality of treatment by increasing the diagnosis accuracy through effort, such that $\eta$ increases when more effort is applied. Where $\eta$ is the level of accuracy in $X^\eta$.The cost of accuracy is given by $c$. Assuming a separable utility function, the physician problem can be expressed as
\[
	v(M,e)=M-c(\eta)
\]
As the subject of this paper, is the acquisition of information, through physician effort, I ignore the treatment decision and assume for simplicity that the payment for treatment $p$ can be set exactly equal to the cost $\omega$. The problem then simplifies to
\begin{align}
v(\delta,\eta)=\delta-c(\eta)\label{eq:phys-utility}
\end{align}
Further, the physician will only apply effort as long as \cref{eq:phys-utility} is positive. Let $\bar{\eta}$ be the solution to $\delta=c(\eta)$. Then $\bar{\eta}$ must be between $[0,\bar{\eta}]$.

If I let $\lambda\in[0,1]$ be the physician preference for effort we can restate the physicans problem in \cref{eq:phys-utility} as
\begin{align*}
 	 v(\delta,\lambda,\bar{\eta})=\delta-c(\lambda\bar{\eta})\label{eq:phys-utility2}
\end{align*}

%% The patients search for treatment in a static setting
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The patients search for treatment}

While a patient will always prefer more accuracy to less, the patient also has an acceptable minimum level of accuracy $\ubar{\eta}$. $\ubar{\eta}$ is obtained from the patients acceptable level of treatment accuracy, such that if the level of accuracy $\eta\geq\ubar{\eta}$ leads to a treatment $t_1\leq t \leq t_2$ the patient will be satisfied and continue to consult the same physician. If $\eta\leq\ubar{\eta}$, such that $t\notin [t_1,t_2]$, the patient will consult another physician. In insinuative terms, the patient has an expectation to the level of health he will experience after treatment. In the extreme cases where the patients expects perfect health (no change in health) $t_1=t^*=t_2$ ($-\infty< t^* <\infty$).

The patient does not know $\lambda$. But he knows the distribution of $Q(\lambda,\rho)$, where $\lambda$ is a realization of $\Lambda$ and $\rho$ is a risk parameter, characterizing the market dispersion. %Further I also assume that the probability $P(\lambda)$ of $t\in [t_1,t_2]$ is increasing in $\lambda$

\subsection[A simplified proof of Topkis’s Monotonicity Theorem is]{A simplified proof of \Citeauthor{Topkis1998}'s Monotonicity Theorem}
\begin{thm}
	Consider the problem
	\[
		t^*(s)=\argmax_{s\in S} u(t,s)
	\]
	where $T,S\in \mathbb{R}$ and $T_s\subset T$ is the correspondence from $S$ to $T$, with $T_s$ being the set of feasible treatments, when the diseases is $s$. Assume also that (i) $u$ has increasing differences in $(t,s)$, and (ii) $T_s=[g(s),h(s)]$, where $h,g:S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are increasing functions with $g\leq h$. Then the optimal solution $t^*(s)$ is an increasing function.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	The proof is done by contradiction. Assume that $t^*(s)$ is not increasing. Then for some $s'>s$, $t^*(s')<t^*(s)$. Then using assumption (ii) and the fact that $t^*(s)\in T_s$, and $t^*(s')\in T_{s'}$, it follows that $g(s)\leq g(s')\leq t^*(s') < t^*(s) \leq h(s) \leq h(s')$, so that $t^*(s)\in T_{s'}$ and $t^*(s')\in T_s$. Using the latter facts along with $t^*(s)\in t(s)$ and $t^*(s')\in t(s')$, we have
	\[
		0\geq u[s',t^*(s)]-u[s',t^*(s')]\geq u[s,t^*(s)]-u[s,t^*(s')]\geq 0,
	\]
which holds throughout. Hence, $t^*(s)\in t(s')$ is a contradiction to the fact that $t^*(s')=\max \{t(s')\}$, since $t^*(s')<t^*(s)$. Hence, $t^*(s)$ is an increasing function \parencite{Amir2005a}.\footnote{In this proof, it is assumed that $T_s\cap T_{s'}\ne \emptyset$If this was the case, one would trivially have that $t^*(s)<t^*(s')$}

\end{proof}
