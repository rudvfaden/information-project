@article{Rochaix1989,
abstract = {This paper offers an integrated approach to the physician-patient interaction based on the notion of a conditional demand function where the physician ‘proposes’ and the patient ‘disposes’. The model specifies the information asymmetry between the physician and the patient mainly in terms of a differential in uncertainty about the patient's health status. An imperfect agency may result, leading some physicians to recommend more (less) treatment than the patient would have chosen, had the patient been fully informed. But patients are shown to exert pressure on their physician by potentially seeking a second opinion. In effect, patients' search for an adequate treatment becomes an ex ante monitoring technique, which induces physicians to act as ‘better agents’. We further show, by means of a simulation, that it is enough for a small number of patients to be well informed for this result to hold.},

This note discusses the erroneous criticisms in his papers. First, although, we estimated a Marshallian demand curve, our calculations are based on compensating variations that incorporate the gains from risk pooling. Second, our estimates of second best insurance plans indicate that some cost sharing is optimal, in contradiction to his assertion that our results raise questions about the desirability of insurance coverage. The comment also deals with other issues raised by Nyman.},

@article{Schwartz1988,
abstract = {In the Philippines most women choose to deliver at home despite the presence of modern facilities. Policy-making requires a knowledge of the factors that determine that choice, especially in terms of variables like price and location, which are amenable to policy intervention. Over 2/3 of the babies born in low-income countries are delivered by traditional birth attendants who are uneducated and have no formal training. They are, however, available in rural areas, whereas 70-90\% of the modern practitioners are in the cities. Recently efforts have been made to expand modern obstetrical services in developing countries, but few surveys are available documenting the impact of modern facilities on delivery patterns. The present survey collected data from 3075 women who had singleton births on the island of Cebu between 1983 and 1984, as well as data from 48 modern public and private health facilities and 88 modern and traditional health practitioners. For the analysis of these data an economic demand model was built, using the mixed multinomial logit technic to estimate relationships between delivery characteristics, mothers' characteristics, and delivery choice. Money prices were not a significant factor in the choices, but time prices were a significant consideration for the rural sample. Hours of availability were a significant factor for both urban and rural mothers, and availability of drugs was significant for the urban sample. Both rural and urban women preferred delivery by a midwife, trained or not, to delivery by a combination of doctors, nurses, and midwives. With few exceptions, income was not a significant factor, and having insurance (10\% of the sample) increased the probability of choosing a modern private practitioner. Money price effects were inelastic; i.e., a price increase by modern facilities would not have much effect on the choice of these facilities, and lowering the price of modern public delivery services would do little to increase demand for them. Locating more public practitioners and facilities in rural areas could effectively increase the use of modern facilities by rural women. Both urban and rural women would increase their use of modern public away-from-home facilities if these facilities would increase their hours of operation. Having drugs available would also increase the use of the public away-from-home facilities. In both urban and rural samples, trained midwives were the practitioners of choice. Among rural women a rise in income would increase the likelihood of their choosing public and private away-from-home deliveries and home deliveries by private practitioners. From the point of view of public policy, the most significant implications of the study are: 1) decreasing travel time for rural women by locating modern facilities and practitioners in rural areas would increase the use of modern delivery services; 2) increasing hours of operation, increasing the availability of drugs, and providing trained midwives at public facilities would increase the use of modern delivery services; 3) decreasing money prices would not increase use of modern public delivery services; and 4) increasing the price for cost recovery would not decrease the use of modern public delivery services.},

abstract = {
The general medical services (GMS) scheme provides care free at the point of use for the 30\% most economically deprived section of the population and the elderly. Almost all people of over-70-year olds are eligible for the GMS scheme potentially directing resources away from those most in need. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between practice GMS income and deprivation amongst Dublin-based general practitioners (GPs). The practice GMS income in Dublin was analysed in relation to practice characteristics including the number of GPs, catchment area population, proportion of over-70-year olds in the catchment area, catchment deprivation, number of GMS GPs within 2 km, and average GMS practice income within 2 km. Practice GMS income was highest in deprived areas but is also a valuable source of income in the least deprived areas. The capitation rate for over-70-year olds provides an incentive for GPs to locate in affluent areas and potentially directs resources away from those in greater need.

competition between hierarchies under the assumption of secret wholesale

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to identify key issues concerning the nature of competition in health care markets and its impacts on quality and social welfare and to identify pertinent findings from the theoretical and empirical literature on this topic. The theoretical literature in economics on competition and quality, the theoretical literature in health economics on this topic, and the empirical findings on competition and quality in health care markets are surveyed and their findings assessed. Theory is clear that competition increases quality and improves consumer welfare when prices are regulated (for prices above marginal cost), although the impacts on social welfare are ambiguous. When firms set both price and quality, both the positive and normative impacts of competition are ambiguous. The body of empirical work in this area is growing rapidly. At present it consists entirely of work on hospital markets. The bulk of the empirical evidence for Medicare patients shows that quality is higher in more competitive markets. The empirical results for privately insured patients are mixed across studies.},

@article{Woodward1998a,
abstract = {This paper employs classical concepts of diminishing marginal utility to demonstrate that risk-aversion can increase the perceived value of diagnostic procedures and thus raise optimum diagnostic expenditures. The theory is applied to a model in the spirit of Phelps and Mushlin's initial technology assessments. The specific evaluation is the cost-effectiveness of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy used to detect distant metastases of carcinoid liver tumours in a patient otherwise eligible for surgical resection of the liver. Data for the model are taken from published sources and financial databases, when available, and otherwise from a senior clinician's experience (LKK). The quantitative results indicate that receptor scintigraphy may have two beneficial impacts to risk-neutral individuals. First, it may reduce the combined costs of therapy and treatment because the diagnostic procedure costs less than the expected savings generated by avoiding inappropriate surgeries. Second, it may improve the patient's expected health-status-adjusted life years (HSALY) because the information allows physicians to better match treatment to the cancer's stage. Finally the paper demonstrates that risk aversion, as embodied in classical diminishing marginal utility applied to health status, can increase the value of the diagnostic tests and can lead the patient to choose a less beneficial treatment. An illustrative risk-averse utility function changed the optimum treatment from surgery to chemotherapy and increased scintigraphy's benefit by 500\%.},

Both purely cooperative regimes and states representing a mix of conditionally cooperative with noncooperative strategies turn out to be possible outcomes of the selection process, but only the latter correspond to evolutionarily stable strategies. Two-person games differ qualitatively from games with three or more players in that they are more propitious to cooperative regimes. Spontaneous cooperation in general collective-action games therefore appears less likely than much of the recent literature seems to indicate.},

This dual role gives the physician incentive to recommend treatments whose costs outweigh their medical benefits.

The level of inducement chosen by the physician is shown to depend on the price and potential medical benefits of treatment and the relative diagnostic skills of physician and patient. This model offers several testable hypotheses, some of which are confirmed by related studies.},

Observers of this phenomena have invoked "flat of the curve medicine" to explain these facts, and have advocated for reductions in spending in high-use areas. In contrast, we develop a simple Roy model of patient treatment choice with productivity spillovers that can generate the empirical facts. Our model predicts that high-use areas will have higher returns to surgery, better outcomes among patients most appropriate for surgery, and worse outcomes among patients least appropriate for surgery, while displaying no relationship between treatment intensity and overall outcomes. Using data on treatments for heart attacks, we find strong empirical support for these and other predictions of our model, and reject alternative explanations such as waste or supplier induced demand, for geographic variation in medical care.},

We set up a model of GP referral for the Norwegian health care system, where a GP receives capitation payment based on the number of patients in his practice, as well as fee-for-service reimbursements. A GP may accept new patients or close the practice to new patients. We model GPs as partially altruistic, and compete for patients. We show that a GP operating in a more competitive market has a higher referral rate. To compete for patients and to retain them, a GP satisfies patients' requests for referrals. Furthermore, a GP who faces a patient shortage will refer more often than a GP who does not. Tests with Norwegian GP radiology referral data support our theory.},

Using a 12-year county-level panel, we find that a 10 percent increase in births that occur in hospitals with EMRs reduces neonatal mortality by 16 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is driven by a reduction of deaths from conditions requiring careful monitoring. We also find a strong decrease in mortality when we instrument for EMR adoption using variation in state medical privacy laws. Rough cost-effectiveness calculations suggest that EMRs are associated with a cost of \$531,000 per baby’s life saved.},

abstract = {Existing models suggest that reciprocity is unlikely to evolve in large groups as a result of natural selection. In these models, reciprocators punish noncooperation by with-holding future cooperation, and thus also penalize other cooperators in the group. Here, we analyze a model in which the response is some form of punishment that is directed solely at noncooperators. We refer to such alternative forms of punishment as retribution. We show that cooperation enforced by retribution can lead to the evolution of cooperation in two qualitatively different ways. (1) If benefits of cooperation to an individual are greater than the costs to a single individual of coercing the other n − 1 individuals to cooperate, then strategies which cooperate and punish noncooperators, strategies which cooperate only if punished, and, sometimes, strategies which cooperate but do not punish will coexist in the long run. (2) If the costs of being punished are large enough, moralistic strategies which cooperate, punish noncooperators, and punish those who do not punish noncooperators can be evolutionarily stable. We also show, however, that moralistic strategies can cause any individually costly behavior to be evolutionarily stable, whether or not it creates a group benefit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined the impact of duration of physician-patient ties on the processes and costs of medical care.

METHODS: The analyses used a nationally representative sample of Americans 65 years old or older who participated in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey in 1991 and had a usual source of care.

RESULTS: Older Americans have long-standing ties with their physicians; among those with a usual source of care, 35.8\% had ties enduring 10 years or more. Longer ties were associated with a decreased likelihood of hospitalization and lower costs. Compared with patients with a tie of 1 year or less, patients with ties of 10 years or more incurred \$316.78 less in Part B Medicare costs, after adjustment for key demographic and health characteristics. However, substantial impacts on the use of selected preventive care services and the adoption of certain healthy behaviors were not observed.

CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that long-standing physician-patient ties foster less expensive, less intensive medical care. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to understand how duration of tie influences the processes and outcomes of care.},

abstract = {General practice reform is occurring in a number of countries. Little is known, however, of the effects of remunerating general practitioners on the costs and outcomes of care. Valuable lessons can be learned for the scope and design of future research, however, from the existing literature on the effects of general practioner (GP) remuneration. The objectives of this paper are to highlight some of the problems and pitfalls that should be avoided in any further research on the effects of GP remuneration and to identify the main issues for future research. Eighteen studies of the effects of GP remuneration have been reviewed, with a focus on the methods used. Eight studies addressed the effect of changes in the level of remuneration, three evaluated the effect of special payments and bonuses and seven assessed the effects of different remuneration systems. Although there are often practical constraints on the choice of study design, crude 'before and after' analyses and the use of aggregate data should be avoided in favour of prospective evaluations using consultation-based data. The studies reviewed did not evaluate the effects of remuneration on patient welfare and were characterised by the omission of major confounding variables and an inability to generalise to other settings. These issues present a considerable challenge to researchers, GPs and policy makers.},

This paper examines the potential contributions to health economics of the ideas of behavioral economics. The discussion presented here focuses on the economics of doctor-patient interactions and some aspects of quality of care. It also touches on issues related to insurance and the demand for health care. The paper argues that long standing research impasses may be aided by applying concepts from behavioral economics.},

Economic Analysis in Health Care provides a comprehensive coverage of both the economics of health care systems and the evaluation of health care technologies.  It has been written as a core textbook for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students with knowledge of economic analysis and will appeal to an international audience. Adopts an international perspective, using examples and case studies from the UK, the rest of Europe, and other countries. Contains detailed exposition of the economic theory alongside relevant examples and applications Focuses on both market-related and economic evaluation aspects of health economics (some books focus purely on market-related aspects) Strong author team with very broad experience of writing and teaching health economics},

@article{oaxaca1981,
abstract = {This paper explores the issues and pitfalls encountered when attempting
to test empirically the hypothesis that physician, hospital, or any
other input supply level induces increasing demand for health services
in the strict sense of demand shift and, through that, increased
demand for the input in question. Evidence is presented which suggests
that an empirical test of the supplier induced demand (SID) hypothesis
of the type traditionally performed may not in fact be feasible with
cross-sectional aggregate data such as is usually used. Since utilization
rates are higher where there are more health-care resources, increases
in the supply of hospital beds and number of physicians may lead
to increases in the amount of health care sought. Congressional Budget
Office [2, p. ii] There was once a cholera epidemic in Russia. The
government, in an effort to stem the disease, sent doctors to the
worst-affected areas. The peasants in the province of S\_discussed
the situation and observed a very high correlation between the number
of doctors in a given area and the incidence of cholera in that area.
Relying on this hard fact, they rose and murdered their doctors.

abstract = {The article examines the developments in the standard theoretical framework of health economics. Health economics theory has provided a fertile ground for empirical analysis. Health economists are data rich, profiting from the availability of large administrative datasets, quasi-experimental policy changes, demonstration projects, and randomized experiments. These resources have allowed empirical analysts to assess the price elasticity of demand, the extent of adverse selection, and the effects of asymmetric information in health care markets. Recent developments in health economics theory shed new light on important policy problems, help to explain several persistent anomalies, and provide a rationale for novel policy approaches. Theories of the demand for health insurance that incorporate state-dependent utility help explain why health insurance contracts increasingly rely on cost-containment methods other than pure demandside cost sharing. Cost-sharing alone is not an efficient way},

abstract = {Summary This paper develops necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of solutions to an optimization problem to be nondecreasing in a weak sense still strong enough to guarantee the existence of an increasing selection, and thus strong enough to guarantee monotonicity when the solution is unique, as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of optimizers to be nondecreasing in a strong sense which is strong enough to rule out the possibility of a decreasing selection. These necessary and sufficient conditions are variations of quasisupermodularity and the single crossing property introduced in Milgrom-Shannon [13]. Moreover, to determine when an objective function satisfies these conditions, this paper develops several characterizations of quasisupermodularity and the single crossing property and their variants, both in terms of differential conditions and in terms of restrictions on the structure of the level sets of these functions. Several examples are given to choice theory under loss aversion and to an auction problem.},

@article{Wennberg1982,
abstract = {This paper discusses the puzzling problem of large differences in per capita use of certain common surgical procedures among neighboring populations, which by all available measures are quite similar in need for and access to services. The evidence reviewed here supports the hypothesis that variations occur to a large extent because of differences among physicians in their evaluation of patients (diagnosis) or in their belief in the value of the procedures for meeting patient needs (therapy). This hypothesis, which we call the professional uncertainty hypothesis, is germane to current controversies concerning the nature and extent of supplier influence on the demand for medical services. It is also important because of its implications for health regulatory policy. Our plan is to (1) review the relevance of the hypotheses for the supplier-induced demand controversy; (2) review the epidemiologic evidence on the nature and causes of variation; (3) examine patterns of use of common surgical procedures to illustrate the importance of supplier influence on utilization; and (4) consider some of the implications of the professional uncertainty hypotheses for public policy.},

True costs per patient are not a possible basis for payment, and
contracts can only be written on the basis of allocated cost. Payers

allocation, or a payment scheme that would give some weight to each
of these two. Icharacterize the payers'equilibrium contracts arid
show how in equilibrium hospital input decisions are distorted by
the payers' incentives to engage in cost shifting. Two cost-shifting
incentives work in opposite directions, and equilibrium can be characterized
by too little or too much care relative to the socially efficient

@book{Wooldridge2002,
abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Danish version of the 23-item EUROPEP questionnaire measuring patient evaluation of general practice has not been evaluated with regard to psychometric properties. This study aimed to assess data quality and internal consistency and to validate the proposed factorial structure. SETTING: General practice in Denmark. SUBJECTS: A total of 703 general practitioners (GPs). Some 83,480 questionnaires were distributed to consecutive patients aged 18 or more attending practice during the daytime. A total of 56,594 eligible patients responded (67.8\%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data quality (mean, median, item response, missing, floor and ceiling effects), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and average inter-item correlation), item-rest correlations. Model fit from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The distribution was skewed to the left for almost all items with a small floor effect (0.1-9.3\%) and a ceiling effect larger than 15\% (18.6-56.3\%). Item response was high. For seven items "not applicable/relevant" represented more than 10\% of the answers. Internal consistency was good. Item-rest correlations were below 0.60 for three items, and four items had lower correlations with their own domain than with other domains. CFA showed that four domains were highly correlated and that model fit was good for two indices (TLI and SRMR), acceptable for one index (CFI), and poor for three indices (chi-squared, RMSEA and WRMR). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed high ceiling effects, a few items with low item-rest correlation and low item discriminant validity, and an uncertain model fit. There seems to be a need for developing response categories to bring down the ceiling effect and it is also unclear how to use the proposed domains. Future research should focus on evaluating the factorial structure when ceiling effect has been lowered, on whether items should be deleted, and on assessing the unidimensionality of each domain.},

abstract = {General practice is the corner stone of Danish primary health care. General practitioners (GPs) are similar to family physicians in the United States. On average, all Danes have 6.9 contacts per year with their GP (in-person, telephone, or E-mail consultation). General practice is characterized by 5 key components: (1) a list system, with an average of close to 1600 persons on the list of a typical GP; (2) the GP as gatekeeper and first-line provider in the sense that a referral from a GP is required for most office-based specialists and always for in- and outpatient hospital treatment; (3) an after-hours system staffed by GPs on a rota basis; (4) a mixed capitation and fee-for-service system; and (5) GPs are self-employed, working on contract for the public funder based on a national agreement that details not only services and reimbursement but also opening hours and required postgraduate education. The contract is (re)negotiated every 2 years. General practice is embedded in a universal tax-funded health care system in which GP and hospital services are free at the point of use. The current system has evolved over the past century and has shown an ability to adapt flexibly to new challenges. Practice units are fairly small: close to 2 GPs per unit plus nurses and secretaries. The units are fully computerized, that is, with computer-based patient records and submission of prescriptions digitally to pharmacies etc. Over the past few years a decrease in solo practices has been seen and is expected to accelerate, in part because of the GP age structure, with many GPs retiring and new GPs not wanting to practice alone. This latter workforce trend is pointing toward a new model with employed GPs, particularly in rural areas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Comorbidity adjustment is an important component of health services research and clinical prognosis. When adjusting for comorbidities in statistical models, researchers can include comorbidities individually or through the use of summary measures such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index or Elixhauser score. We examined the conditions under which individual versus summary measures are most appropriate. METHODS:: We provide an analytic proof of the utility of comorbidity summary measures when used in place of individual comorbidities. We compared the use of the Charlson and Elixhauser scores versus individual comorbidities in prognostic models using a SEER-Medicare data example. We examined the ability of summary comorbidity measures to adjust for confounding using simulations. RESULTS:: We devised a mathematical proof that found that the comorbidity summary measures are appropriate prognostic or adjustment mechanisms in survival analyses. Once one knows the comorbidity score, no other information about the comorbidity variables used to create the score is generally needed. Our data example and simulations largely confirmed this finding. CONCLUSIONS:: Summary comorbidity measures, such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Elixhauser scores, are commonly used for clinical prognosis and comorbidity adjustment. We have provided a theoretical justification that validates the use of such scores under many conditions. Our simulations generally confirm the utility of the summary comorbidity measures as substitutes for use of the individual comorbidity variables in health services research. One caveat is that a summary measure may only be as good as the variables used to create it.},

In this paper we attempt to fill that gap by developing and testing a model of the effect of alternative compensation arrangements on productive efficiency in medical group practices. The technique employed is maximum likelihood production frontier estimation. We provide a simple behavioral model of the determination of productive efficiency and a new interpretation of the economic measure of technical efficiency. We derive a "behavioral production function" that relates production to individual responses to incentives, and we indicate the impossibility of recovering the parameters of the production technology from observed behavior. Overall, the empirical results indicate that incentives do affect productivity. A larger number of members in a group decreases productivity while greater average experience leads to greater productivity.},

For d=1 the series that need to be differenced to achieve stationarity occur, but this case is not found to occur from aggregation. It is suggested that if series obeying such models occur in practice, from aggregation, then present techniques being used for analysis are not appropriate.},

Our goal is to understand the adjustment in contract terms as a function of accident histories in a finite horizon model. We also compare these adjustments between alternative market structures. Our principal findings indicate that history dependent insurance contracts serve a useful sorting role. Individuals who declare themselves ‘low risks’ to insurance companies face adverse contractural terms if they subsequently have many accidents. These adjustments are strongest in the case of a single insurance seller but are present in the competitive model as well.},

abstract = {Determining,the value of information is a fundamental research problem for information system scientists. Unfortunately, very little research exists that examines the relationship between risk aversion and the value of information. This is surprising because empirical studies show that most managers are risk averse rather than risk neutral. Moreover, the small literature that exists appears to be in conflict. We have developed a framework to examine the relationship between the value of information and risk aversion. We show that the method of payment for information must be considered in determining this relationship. We have used the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion to derive explicit conditions under which the value of information increases (decreases) with risk aversion. From our analysis it is clear that earlier work has depicted a limited view of the relationship between risk aversion and value of information. Our analysis is applicable to the ex-post evaluation of transaction processing systems and a subset of decision and expert support systems.},

@article{Devlin2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although we are observing a general move towards larger primary care practices, surprisingly little is known about the influence of key components of practice organization on primary care. We aimed to determine the relationships between practice size, and revenue sharing agreements, and quality of care.

METHODS: As part of a large cross sectional study, group practices were randomly selected from different primary care service delivery models in Ontario. Patient surveys and chart reviews were used to assess quality of care. Multilevel regressions controlled for patient, provider and practice characteristics.

RESULTS: Positive statistically significant associations were found between the logarithm of group size and access, comprehensiveness, and disease prevention. Negative significant associations were found between logarithm group size and continuity. No differences were found for chronic disease management and health promotion. Practices that shared revenues were found to deliver superior health promotion compared to those who did not. Interacting group size with the presence of a revenue-sharing arrangement had a negative impact on health promotion.

CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of our study, our findings have provided preliminary evidence of the tradeoffs inherent with increasing practice size. Larger group size is associated with better access and comprehensiveness but worse continuity of care. Revenue sharing in group practices was associated with higher health promotion compared to sharing only common costs. Further work is required to better inform policy makers and practitioners as to whether the pattern revealed in larger practices mitigates any of the previously reported benefits of continuity of primary care. We found few benefits of revenue sharing -- even then the effect of revenue sharing on health promotion seemed diminished in larger practices.},

We find 'evidence' of inducement of childbirths, calling into question the validity of the TSLS approach. This unlikely finding may be traced to at least two factors: The first stage regression is not identified and the second stage regression does not adequately address border crossing.},

They can serve as a basis for budgeting, cost control, and quality control in hospitals. They were adopted by Medicare in 1983 to serve as a basis for a prospective payment system (PPS) for US hospitals. This system has resulted in savings of more than \$50 billion in Medicare hospital payments through 1990 and extended the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund well into the next century. Many other payers for hospital care have adopted DRG systems, including state Medicaid programs and private insurers, such as Blue Cross. More than 20 countries are currently developing or have adopted DRG-based systems for managing and financing hospital care.},

Using a new direct measure of information, the econometric approach
treats both information and physician visits as endogenous variables
when estimating the demand for medical care. The results show that
information increases the probability that a consumer uses medical
care, but that conditional on use the quantity of care consumed is
not related to information. The results contradict specific implications
of models where physicians can create or induce demand for their
own services. Several results suggest that poorly informed consumers
tend to underestimate the productivity of medical care in treating
illness.},

abstract = {Proponents of tort reform applied to medical malpractice argue for change partly on the premise that the threat of lawsuits has made medical care more costly. Using U.S. longitudinal data from the National Long-Term Care Survey merged with Medicare claims and other data for 1985-2000, this study assesses whether tort reforms have reduced Medicare payments made on behalf of beneficiaries and the survival probability following an index event. Direct reforms (caps on damages, abolition of punitive damages, eliminating mandatory prejudgment interest, and collateral source offset) did not significantly reduce payments for Medicare-covered services in any specification. Indirect reforms (limitations on contingency fees, mandatory periodic payments, joint-and-several liability reform, and patient compensation funds) significantly reduced Medicare payments only in a specification based on any hospitalization, but not in analysis of hospitalization for each of four common chronic conditions. Neither direct nor indirect reforms had a significant effect on the health outcomes, with one exception. The overall conclusion is that tort reforms do not significantly affect medical decisions, nor do they have a systematic effect on patient outcomes.},

The implications for public and private fee policy, and empirical research on physician response to fees, are discussed.},

Our analysis focuses on two issues: controlling overall program expenditures, and assuring full access to care for program clients. We review evidence from natural experiments in which payment levels were increased, frozen, or decreased. These studies show that freezing or reducing payment levels is not effective in controlling program expenditures, because physicians responded by increasing the quantity and complexity of services provided. Furthermore, when government programs freeze or reduce their payment levels, physicians are less likely to treat the clients of these programs. We conclude that policymakers must seek alternative strategies for controlling program expenditures.},

abstract = {General practice computers have been widely used in the United Kingdom for the last 10 years and there are over 30 different systems currently available. The commercially available databases are based on two of the most widely used systems--VAMP Medical and Meditel. These databases provide both longitudinal and cross-sectional data on between 1.8 and 4 million patients. Despite their availability only limited use has been made of them for epidemiological and health service research purposes. They are a unique source of population-based information and deserve to be better recognized. The advantages of general practice databases include the fact that they are population based with excellent prescribing data linked to diagnosis, age and gender. The problems are that their primary purpose is patient care and the database population is constantly changing, as well as the usual problems of bias and confounding that occur in any observational studies. The barriers to the use of general practice databases include the cost of access, the size of the databases and that they are not structured in a way that easily allows analysis. Proper utilization of these databases requires powerful computers, staff proficient in writing computer programs to facilitate analysis and epidemiologists skilled in their use. If these structural problems are overcome then the databases are an invaluable source of data for epidemiological studies.},

@article{Blackorby1989a,
abstract = {The elasticity of substitution was originally introduced by the economist, John R. Hicks (1932), for the purpose of analyzing changes in the income shares of labor and capital in a growing economy. The economists, R. G. D. Allen and Hicks (1934) suggested two generalizations of the original elasticity concept to the case of more than two inputs. The first, which is called the Hicks' elasticity of substitution (HES), and is defined by applying the two-input formula to each pair of inputs, holding constant all other input quantities This concept generates the ordinary elasticity of substitution as a special case when there are only two inputs. It also provides some information about curvature, but not information that has relevance for the comparative statics of factor shares. This is because it does not allow for optimal adjustment of all inputs to a change in a price ratio. The second generalization concept was called the "partial elasticity of substitution," but no intuition was provided to convince one that it is a natural generalization of the two-variable elasticity of substitution.},

abstract = {Using population-based automated pharmacy data, patterns of use of selected prescription medications during a 1 year time period identified by a consensus judgement process were used to construct a measure of chronic disease status (Chronic Disease Score). This score was evaluated in terms of its stability over time and its association with other health status measures. In a pilot test sample of high utilizers of ambulatory health care well known to their physicians (n = 219), Chronic Disease Score (CDS) was correlated with physician ratings of physical disease severity (r = 0.57). In a second random sample of patients (n = 722), its correlation with physician-rated disease severity was 0.46. In a total population analysis (n = 122,911), it was found to predict hospitalization and mortality in the following year after controlling for age, gender and health care visits. In a population sample (n = 790), CDS showed high year to year stability (r = 0.74). Based on health survey data, CDS showed a moderate association with self rated health status and self reported disability. Unlike self-rated health status and health care utilization, CDS was not associated with depression or anxiety. We conclude that scoring automated pharmacy data can provide a stable measure of chronic disease status that, after controlling for health care utilization, is associated with physician-rated disease severity, patient-rated health status, and predicts subsequent mortality and hospitalization rates. Specific methods of scoring automated pharmacy data to measure global chronic disease status may require adaptation to local prescribing practices. Scoring might be improved by empirical estimation of weighting factors to optimize prediction of mortality and other health status measures.},

abstract = {Income motivation among general practitioners (GPs) is frequently discussed in the health economics literature. The question addressed in the present study on reimbursement drugs and addictive drugs is whether increased competition among GPs, which is part of a declared health policy to improve efficiency, contributes to more prescriptions for the elderly. The dataset comprises registered data of all prescribed drugs dispensed at pharmacies from the Norwegian Prescription Database merged with data on GPs. In choosing a method, particular attention is given to the fact that patients tend to be attracted to GPs who fit their preferences. Hence, we treat the composition of the patient list as endogenous. The results indicate that the stronger competition a GP faces, the more drugs are prescribed, which implies that GPs' prescription style may conflict with their role as gatekeepers, and even worse, it may be a hazard to patients' health.},

@article{Wolinsky1993,
abstract = {This article investigates how information asymmetries affect the organization
of markets in which sellers are also experts who determine customers'
needs. It examines how customers' search for multiple opinions and
reputation considerations each play a role in disciplining experts.
It shows that customer search may give rise to an equilibrium in
which experts specialize in different levels of the service. It discusses
the effect of the search-cum-diagnosis costs on the market's organization:
experts are more likely to be disciplined by customer search or by
reputation according to whether these costs are lower or higher.
It also shows that when experts are liable to make diagnosis errors,
there is a negative search externality that tends to raise prices.

abstract = {Canada is a leader in experimenting with alternative, non fee for service provider remuneration methods; all jurisdictions have implemented salaries and payment models that blend fee for service with salary or capitation components. A series of qualitative interviews were held with 27 stakeholders in the Canadian health care system to assess the reasons and expectations behind the implementation of these payment methods for family physicians, as well as the extent to which objectives have been achieved. Results indicate that the main reasons are a need to recruit and retain primary care physicians to rural and remote regions of the country, and the desire to increase collaboration, care continuity, prevention and health promotion. The general perception is that positive results have been observed, but problems are not alleviated. Blended payments have had some positive effects on preventive care delivery, collaboration, and care continuity. Salaries have provided a stable, predictable, and high source of income for physicians, thereby improving recruitment and retention. The implementation of salaries, however, led to concerns with declining physician productivity, and has brought to light a need for improved measurement and monitoring systems.},

It is shown that this condition identifies a class of health production functions, which may provide useful guidance to empirical studies that depend wholly or partly on the correct specification of a health production function. As an illustration, it is demonstrated that this class of production functions may be useful for empirical studies that test the hypothesis that schooling, increasing the efficiency of health production, leads to a larger health output from a given set of health inputs. The paper also offers broader classes of production functions that would enable one to test this relationship between the demand elasticity and the effect of health care productivity on health care demand.},

We tested this prediction using three samples of wages and hours of New York City cabdrivers, whose wages are correlated within days but uncorrelated between days. Estimated wage elasticities are significantly negative in two out of three samples. Elasticities of inexperienced drivers average approximately −1 and are less than zero in all three samples (and significantly less than for experienced drivers in two of three samples). Our interpretation of these findings is that cabdrivers (at least inexperienced ones): (i) make labor supply decisions '' one day at a time'' instead of intertemporally substituting labor and leisure across multiple days, and (ii) set a loose daily income target and quit working once they reach that target.},

@article{Allard2011,
abstract = {This paper analyzes and compares the incentive properties of some common payment mechanisms for GPs, namely fee for service (FFS), capitation and fundholding. It focuses on gatekeeping GPs and it specifically recognizes GPs heterogeneity in both ability and altruism. It also allows inappropriate care by GPs to lead to more serious illnesses. The results are as follows. Capitation is the payment mechanism that induces the most referrals to expensive specialty care. Fundholding may induce almost as much referrals as capitation when the expected costs of GPs care are high relative to those of specialty care. Although driven by financial incentives of different nature, the strategic behaviors associated with fundholding and FFS are very much alike. Finally, whether a regulator should use one or another payment mechanism for GPs will depend on (i) his priorities (either cost-containment or quality enhancement) which, in turn, depend on the expected cost difference between GPs care and specialty care, and (ii) the distribution of profiles (diagnostic ability and altruism levels) among GPs.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Soft tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of tumours with a wide range of clinical behaviour. Exact determination of diagnosis and prognosis is critical in order to guide surgical decisions and provide systemic therapy or radiation for patients. The value of consultative second opinions has been proven for general surgical pathology; some studies suggest an even higher value for the soft tissue tumour specimens in particular.

METHODS: We reviewed 603 patients who were operated on at our institution with the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis; we focused on mismatches in primary and definite tumour-entity and -grading with respect to the diagnosing institution and the primary surgical procedure.

RESULTS: We found concordant primary diagnosis in 28.3\% for pathologists in private clinics, 29.6\% for hospital pathologists, 36.8\% for academic medical centres (university hospitals) and 70.5\% for the Department of Pathology at our institution. An improvement in diagnosis or confirmation of the correct primary diagnosis by the second opinion was seen in 73.1\% of the patients; in 2.5\%, the second opinion was false.

DISCUSSION: For accurate determination of prognosis and to provide optimal therapeutic decisions we consider expert second opinion essential for optimal treatment of soft tissue sarcomas.},

When GPs are paid per item, i.e., on a fee-for-service basis (FFS), there is a clear relationship between workload and income: more work means more money. In the case of capitation based payment, workload is not directly linked to income since the fees per patient are fixed. In this study list size was considered as an indicator for workload and we investigated how list size and remuneration affect GP decisions about how they provide consultations. The main objectives of this study were to investigate a) how list size is related to consultation length, waiting time to get an appointment, and the likelihood that GPs conduct home visits and b) to what extent the relationships between list size and these three variables are affected by remuneration.},

abstract = {Understanding how physicians respond to incentives from payment schemes is a central concern in health economics research. We introduce a controlled laboratory experiment to analyse the influence of incentives from fee-for-service and capitation payments on physicians' supply of medical services. In our experiment, physicians choose quantities of medical services for patients with different states of health. We find that physicians provide significantly more services under fee-for-service than under capitation. Patients are overserved under fee-for-service and underserved under capitation. However, payment incentives are not the only motivation for physicians' quantity choices, as patients' health benefits are of considerable importance as well. We find that patients in need of a high (low) level of medical services receive larger health benefits under fee-for-service (capitation).},

@article{Kihlstrom1974a,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to construct a general theory—analogous to the neoclassical theory of consumer demand—of demand for information about product quality. The model proposed here introduces uncertain product quality by assuming that commodities possess attributes which consumers desire and that an uncertain commodity possesses are unknown quantity of some attribute. It is assumed that information about the quality of uncertain products is available. The consumer's utility function of information is derived and his information demand function is obtained. Partial analogues of the neoclassical theorems are proved for information demand. Roughly, we find that the Slutsky matrix is symmetric and that a submatrix is negative definite. The negative definite submatrix contains those terms which measure the effect of (income compensated) changes in information prices on information demand. The analysis employed to obtain these results parallels—with some important modifications—the neoclassical analysis of commodity demand. The method used to obtain expressions for the Slutsky substitution terms is an extension of the approach introduced by McKenzie [10] and later used by Hurwicz and Uzawa [6]. This approach uses an “income compensation” function to arrive at an “income compensated” demand function.},

abstract = {Estimates of health care demand are known to depend on the empirical specification used in the analysis. In this paper, an innovative specification, the finite mixture model (FMM), is employed to estimate the utilization of and expenditures on behavioural health care. Unlike standard specifications, the FMM has the ability to distinguish between distinct classes of users of behavioural health care (e.g. the 'worried well' and the severely mentally ill). This new model is tested against standard empirical specifications using data from the National Medical Expenditure Survey. Using common risk stratifiers, estimates of utilization and costs are generated with each specification. It is found that the FMM provides a much better fit of both expenditure and utilization data than standard specifications, particularly among high intensity users that standard models have been unable to represent adequately. Furthermore, the results provide preliminary evidence that there are (at least) two distinct groups of users of behavioural health care. The empirical advantages of the FMM translate into superior estimates of mean costs and utilization that have widespread application in rate-setting exercises.},

abstract = {This paper examines how changes in Medicare reimbursement rates affect the degree to which physicians induce demand for Medicare services. Demand inducement is measured by analyzing changes in the intensity and quantity of services provided and the number of ancillary services ordered. The empirical work is based on data that include copies of all Medicare claims for Colorado physicians between 1976 and 1978. During that period a change in the state's Medicare reimbursement system occurred, resulting in a large increase in some physicians' reimbursement rates and a relative decrease in those of others. Using this "natural experiment," we can determine how changes in financial incentives affect various forms of demand inducement. The study results are consistent with the theory that demand inducement exists. It appears to take several forms: provision of more highly intensive medical and surgical services, greater quantities of surgical services, and ordering of more laboratory tests.},

Monotone comparative static methods allow researchers to extract robust, substantive empirical implications from formal models that can be tested using ordinal data and simple nonparametric tests. When these methods apply, they can replace a diverse range of more technically difficult mathematics (facilitating richer, more realistic models), assumptions that are hard to understand or justify substantively (highlighting the political intuitions underlying a model's results), and a complicated set of methods for extracting implications from models. We present an accessible introduction to the central monotone comparative statics results and a series of practical tools for using these techniques in applied models (with reference to original sources, when relevant). Throughout we demonstrate the techniques with examples drawn from political science.},

As a result, cooperation breaks down and groups have lower earnings in comparison to a treatment without punishments where free riding is predominant. Approximately one quarter of all punishments are retaliated. Counter-punishments appear to be driven partly by strategic considerations and partly by a desire to reciprocate punishments.},

Using all births in California over the 1995–2000 period, two-stage least-square estimates show that increased treatment intensity had a modest impact on readmission probabilities for the average newborn. Allowing the treatment effect to vary by two objective measures of medical need demonstrates that the law had large impacts for those with the greatest likelihood of a readmission. The results suggest that the returns to average and marginal patients vary considerably in this context.},

We develop a conceptual framework for SID which includes the clinical effectiveness of the health services utilized as well as the effectiveness of the agency relationship between the physician and the patient. The framework is used to identify several conceptually distinct types of utilization--each with its own policy implications--which have been intermingled in the SID literature. After examining each type of utilization, we conclude that a continued focus by health economists on the phenomenon of inducement (even within an extended conceptual framework) may be too limited for the development of policies regarding health service utilization.},

This article reports on efforts to measure how patient-provider Web messaging affects physician productivity. To measure productivity, researchers analyzed the work of a group of physicians using a secure Web messaging system, compared with a control group that did not use the system. Results showed that physicians using the electronic media to communicate had about a 10 percent increase in productivity. Secure Web messaging's benefits also outweigh those of e-mail in increasing productivity and allaying concerns of physicians.},

abstract = {This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for single-equation instrumental variables regression when the partial correlations between the instruments and the endogenous variables are weak, here modeled as local to zero. Asymptotic representations are provided for various statistics, including two-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with 10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate of 6\%, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer instruments fall between 8\% and 10\%, with a typical 95\% confidence interval of (5\%, 15\%).},

abstract = {In the spatial prisoner's dilemma game, an agent's strategy choice depends upon the strategies he expects his neighboring agents to adopt. Yet, the expectation of agents in the games has not been studied seriously by the researchers of games in complex networks. The present paper studies the effect of the agents' adaptive expectation on cooperation emergence in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks from an agent-based approach. Simulation results show that the agents' adaptive expectation will favor the emergence of cooperation. However, due to agents' adaptive behavior, agents' initial expectation level does not greatly affect the cooperation frequency in the experiments. Simulation results also show that the agents' expectation adjustment speed significantly affects the cooperation frequency. In addition, the initial number of cooperation agents on the network is not a critical factor in the simulations. However, together with a bigger defection temptation, a larger neighborhood size will produce greater cooperation frequency fluctuations in a Barab\'{a}si and Albert (BA) network, a feature different from that of Watts and Strogatz (WS) small world networks, which can be explained by their different networks degree distributions. Simulation results show that the cooperation frequency oscillating on the WS network is much smaller than that of the BA networks when defection temptation becomes larger. This research demonstrates that agent's adaptive expectation plays an important role in cooperation emergence on complex networks and it deserves more attentions.},

abstract = {Decision analysis is an explicit, quantitative and prescriptive means
by which the physician can identify optimal clinical strategies under
conditions of uncertainty. It is incomplete, however, since it dispenses
clinical advice without regard for the fact that the patient---for
whatever reason---might choose to reject that advice. Game theory
provides a supplementary means to explicate optimal rational strategies
in situations where the actual outcome depends on the choices of
both the patient and the physician. To determine its potential clinical
relevance, Iused game theory to reassess a clinical problem which
has been used as a textbook exemplar of decision analysis: Should
patients with chronic liver failure undergo liver biopsy before being
treated? Decision analysis prescribes a pure (deterministic) strategy:
the physician should always perform a biopsy. In contrast, given
the proper conditions, game theory mandates a mixed (probabilistic)
strategy: the physician should (randomly) recommend biopsy to only
some fraction of patients, and only some fraction of these should
(randomly) accept this advice. Thus, whenever the patient is free
to accept or reject the physician's advice. game theory provides
a prescriptive decision-making model which is qualitatively and quantitatively
different from decision analysis.},
